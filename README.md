## Getting Started

If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide, as it explains how to create a [gruntfile][Getting Started] as well as install and use grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, install the dependencies with this command:

```sh
npm install
```

Once the dependencies has been installed, the application could be launched by the command:

```sh
grunt serve
```
